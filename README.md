## Setting Up OpenAI API Key

To use RatGPT, you need to set up your OpenAI API key in your environment variables. Follow these steps to configure it:

### For Windows:

1. Open Command Prompt.
2. Set your API key by running the following command: `setx OPENAI_API_KEY "your-api-key-here"`
### For macOS/Linux:

1. Open Terminal.
2. Add your API key to your bash profile by running `'export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"`


After setting up the API key, RatGPT will be able to authenticate with OpenAI's services using this key.
